# Welcome to my profile
Be aware that many of my repos are private as a lot of my work so far has been done in university, therefore I have to private them to avoid academic malpractice. Code or demos of private projects can be made available on request by employers.

## Things im currently working on:
- An indie shoot em' up game
- A website to showcase private projects
